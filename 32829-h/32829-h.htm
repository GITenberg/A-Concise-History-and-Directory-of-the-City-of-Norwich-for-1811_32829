<i>Editor&rsquo;s Address to the Public</i>.</h2>
<p>Nine years have expired since the publication of the last
<span class="smcap">Norwich Directory</span> (which was out of
print almost as soon as in); during which period, alterations
have been constantly taking place in the residence of the
inhabitants, independent of those which have been entirely
removed by death or otherwise.&nbsp; It will be found of those
which were inserted in the former, and are still to be found in
this, not half of them remain in the same residence.&mdash;He was
not aware of the difficulty of obtaining the address of so large
a population, or he would have been deterred from the
undertaking: he has used his utmost endeavors to render it as
correct as possible, and hopes he has made no very flagrant
errors or omissions.&mdash;The <span
class="smcap">Directory</span> contains several hundred names
more than that before noticed&mdash;the historical part is
entirely written and compiled for the present purpose&mdash;many
charitable and public institutions are noticed which cannot be
found elsewhere&mdash;and the lists <!-- page iv--><a
name="pageiv"></a><span class="pagenum">p. iv</span>are much
augmented, and corrected to the present time.&mdash;The
alphabetical order of the <span class="smcap">Directory</span>,
is corrected to the first vowel.</p>
<p>He cannot let this opportunity escape, without returning his
thanks to several gentlemen who have rendered him information he
could not otherwise have obtained.&mdash;He writes not for fame,
but throws himself on an indulgent public; and should his feeble
efforts prove in any degree useful, or meet the approbation of
his fellow-citizens, his end is gained.</p>

<i>HISTORY OF NORWICH</i>.</h2>
<p>In attempting a brief History of Norwich, it shall be
endeavoured, so far as the limits of the design will admit, to
consider its situation and extent, foundation and present state,
former and present population, memorable events, antiquities,
eminent or learned inhabitants, trade, manufactures, &amp;c.</p>
<p>Norwich is situate in 1. 25. E. of London, and in 52. 40. N.
latitude; it lies considerably eastward of the centre of the
county of Norfolk, of which it is the capital, and indeed it may
be considered as the principal city in the eastern district of
the kingdom.&nbsp; It occupies the top and sides of a gentle
hill, which runs parallel with the river Wensum on its western
side; the river suddenly takes an almost western course, and runs
through nearly the centre of the city.&nbsp; It is distinguished
in the annals of Great Britain for its manufactures, the
memorable events that have occurred, its antiquities, and for
various other objects which shall be briefly touched upon.</p>
<p>Norwich, in its present state, is said to <!-- page 2--><a
name="page2"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 2</span>occupy more
ground, comparatively with its population, than any city in the
kingdom, being much interspersed with gardens, and it is
frequently stiled, a city in an orchard; its shape is irregular,
and may not unaptly be compared to a shoulder of mutton&mdash;it
is full one mile and a half in length, and a mile and quarter
broad.&nbsp; It contains thirty four churches and a number of
chapels and meeting houses, besides the cathedral; it has five
bridges over the river; it was formerly nearly surrounded with a
wall, planted with forty two towers and had twelve gates, the
former is dilapidated the latter, within a few years have been
taken down.</p>
<p>The original foundation of Norwich is not easily asertained;
however, it is certain, that the Romans, presently after their
establishment in Britain, either erected fortresses near the
British towns, or invited the natives to assemble round the Roman
military stations; and most of our cities and chief towns occupy
the site of such stations, or are in their immediate vicinity,
which makes it probable, that Norwich orginated in the decay of
(<i>Venta Icenorum</i>) Castor, and which the following old
distich commemorates.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Castor was a city when Norwich was none,<br
/>
&ldquo;And Norwich was built of Castor stone.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Camden says, he had no where met with the name of Norwich
previous to the Danish invasion; on the origin of the name,
various opinions have been formed; however, there is very little
doubt that it received its name from the Saxons, their word
<i>Northwic</i>, signifying a northern station, castle, or town,
and the word <!-- page 3--><a name="page3"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 3</span>occurs on the Saxon coins of various
reigns.&nbsp; Blomfield mentions several of these&mdash;one in
the time of Alfred the Great, about the year 872; another in the
early part of the reign of Athelstan about the year 925, and
several others; besides three coins minted here of Ethelred,
called the <i>Unready</i>, of which it seems, some are yet
extant; and from which it appears, that Norwich was a place of
note before the Danes were in possession of Britain.</p>
<p>The Saxons immediately took advantage of the Romans leaving
Britain, to pour in their own troops, under pretence of
protecting the natives; but they soon threw off the mask, and
erecting fortresses to defend what they had seized, they shortly
became possessed of the whole Island.&nbsp; At this period
&rsquo;tis probable the former Castle of Norwich was first
founded.&nbsp; Vulgar chronology makes it as old as Julius
C&aelig;sar; but its gothic structure belied such
conjecture&mdash;the elevated spot on which this castle stood,
commanding a prospect over a large space of country, pointed it
out as a proper place to fix an advanced post.</p>
<p>Uffa is considered the first Saxon monarch over this part of
the kingdom, in the year 575; but it appears, notwithstanding,
from undoubted authority, that Grecca, the father of Uffa, was
the first sovereign of East Anglia.</p>
<p>The monarchy, therefore, was probably established between the
years 530 and 540, and the castle erected about the same
period.&nbsp; In the year 642 it is said to have been a fortified
royal seat of Anna, the seventh king of the East Anglian
line.</p>
<p><!-- page 4--><a name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
4</span>From this time till the reign of Alfred, we find little
or no mention of the Castle: but during the incursions of the
Danes, it was frequently possessed by them and the Saxons
alternately; and it appears, that king Alfred in his time,
finding the walls and ramparts of Norwich Castle insufficient to
repel the attack of the Danes, caused others to be erected with
the most durable materials.</p>
<p>Norwich Castle was evidently a military station in
Alfred&rsquo;s time, as appears also by the coin struck here,
about the year 872, before noticed; but in the reign of Etheldred
the II. it is described to have been utterly destroyed by an army
under Sweyne, king of Denmark, about the year 1004.&nbsp; In 1010
the Danes again settled in and fortified Norwich, and the Castle
appears to have been rebuilt by Canute, about the year 1018; to
have been first used as a prison in the early part of the 14th
century, and from this period, its history merges into that of
the city.</p>
<p>Mr. Wilkins says, Norwich castle is the best exterior of this
kind of architecture extant.&nbsp; The area of the ancient
castle, including its outer works, contained about 23 acres, the
whole of which was surrounded by a wall; the principal entrance
was by Bar, now Ber-street, through Golden-Ball-lane, by the
Barbican Gate, which was flanked by two towers, and connected
with the external vallum, by a wall; the extent of the outermost
ditch reached on the west part to the edge of the present Market
Pace, on the north to London-lane, which it included; and on the
east almost to King-street; <!-- page 5--><a
name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 5</span>the southern
part reached to the Golden-Ball-lane, where the grand gate
stood.</p>
<p>According to Mr. Wilkins, the entrance into the Barbican was
at the south end of Golden-Ball-Lane, and not at the north, as
Blomfield has it; over each foss in this direction was a bridge,
but only one of them remains; this extends across the inner
ditch, and according to Mr. Wilkins, is formed of &ldquo;the
largest and most perfect arch of Saxon workmanship in the
kingdom.&rdquo;&nbsp; This bridge is nearly 150 feet in extent,
and the Castle stands just across it on the south west part of
the hill; the extent of the Castle from east to west, including a
small tower through which was the principal entrance, is 110 feet
3 inches, and from north to south, 92 feet 10 inches; and the
height to the top of the battlements, 69 feet 6 inches; the
height of the basement story is about 24 feet, which is faced
with rough flint; the upper part is ornamented with small arches
and decorated so as to appear something like Mosaic work; the
small tower before-mentioned on the east side, was of a richer
kind of architecture, called, Bigod&rsquo;s Tower, which is now
chiefly inclosed, defaced or pulled down, as in the year 1793 the
county thought it necessary to erect a new goal, and it was
resolved to attach it to the eastern side of the old
Castle.&nbsp; Mr. Wilkins expresses himself justly indignant at
the addition, which he calls an heterogeneous and discordant
mass.&mdash;This venerable pile has been a castle of defence to
British, Saxon, and Norman kings; it has been the boast and pride
of the province for ages past, yet by this recent change <!--
page 6--><a name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 6</span>it
is bereaved of its ancient beauty; but, surely, whatever
alterations were necessary, they might have preserved the same
character and apparent date of architecture with the mutilated
parts of this stately pile.&nbsp; The interior is also now an
unroofed area, although formerly covered and divided by
floors.&nbsp; The entrance to the top of the Castle is on the
west side, at the south corner by a flight of 99 steps.</p>
<p>The Castle precinct contains upwards of six acres, and the
summit of the hill is in circumference 360 yards, the whole of
which is enclosed with iron palisadoes, as is also the ditch
around it; which, within the last 20 years, have been occupied
for gardens, many of which are tastefully laid out; and the
summit of the hill on all sides commands a most delightful view
of the city and surrounding country.&nbsp; The Castle with the
hill and ditch surrounding it, may be considered a <i>chef
d&rsquo;&oelig;uvre</i>, and the prospect therefrom superior to
any thing of the kind in England.</p>
<p>A panoramic view of the city and surrounding country has been
lately published by Messrs. Stevenson, Matchett, and Stevenson,
taken from several stations on the hill.</p>
<p>The shirehouse which joins the Castle, has lately undergone
complete internal repair, and considerable alteration whereby the
courts are enlarged and rendered much more commodious than
heretofore; and here all county business is transacted, and the
summer assizes held.</p>
<p>The town of <i>Nor</i>-<i>wic</i> probably soon succeeded the
building of the Castle, and became occupied by the Anglo-Romans,
from Castor, at <!-- page 7--><a name="page7"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 7</span>which time it appears to have been
chiefly inhabited by fishermen and merchants.&nbsp; According to
ancient manuscripts, a large arm of the sea flowed up to Norwich,
till about the time of William the Conqueror.&nbsp; There exists
positive evidence of Norwich being a fishing town in the reign of
Canute, about the year 1020.&nbsp; In the time of Edward the
Confessor, about the year 1050, it appears to have had 25
churches, and 1320 Burgesses; during the peaceable reign of
Edward, and his successor, Harold, it continued to increase in
wealth and population.&nbsp; In the year 1075, it experienced a
serious decrease by siege; in about the year 1085, according to
Doomsday book, a great number of houses were uninhabited, yet the
churches were increased to 54, and the houses to 738, which,
allowing six persons to each house, makes the population
4428.&nbsp; In the reign of William II. the bishop&rsquo;s see
was removed from Thetford hither, which together with a great
influx of Jews at that time, made a considerable increase to the
population.&nbsp; In the reign of Henry I. the government of the
city was separated from the castle jurisdiction and in the
following reign licence was granted for Norwich to have coroners
and bailiffs.&nbsp; In the time of Richard I. 1193, the
inhabitants were called citizens.</p>
<p>The city wall was begun in 1294, and finished in 1320.</p>
<p>Previous to the plague in 1348, according to Blomfield, the
population amounted to 70,000; but, surely, this account as
applied to the city, must appear incredible from the extent of
the walls, and from the increase of population since <!-- page
8--><a name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 8</span>1085, a
term of 263 years, the population must have increased sixteen
fold&mdash;a circumstance, I believe, unparalleled in the annals
of History.</p>
<p>In 1336, a great influx of Flemings in consequence of
religious persecution, settled in Norwich, and introduced the
worsted manufactory.</p>
<p>Henry IV. in the year 1403, granted the city a charter, which
made Norwich a county of itself; and from this time it was
governed by a mayor instead of bailiffs; and in 1406, another
charter was obtained for regulating the mode of choosing the
mayor, sheriffs, &amp;c.</p>
<p>This city has suffered greatly at various times by the plague
and scarcity, and few places have sustained more damage by fire,
which may be attributed, in some measure, to the custom of
covering the houses with thatch.&mdash;Two desolating fires which
happened in the latter part of Henry VII&rsquo;s reign, induced
the corporation to make a law, that no new building should
afterwards be covered with thatch.</p>
<p>Norwich was beginning to decline, but again revived in 1566,
by the settling here of about 300 Dutch and Walloons, who had
fled from the persecution of the Duke of Alva; and their number
kept increasing very rapidly for several years.&nbsp; About this
time, bombasines and some other valuable articles were invented
here, and contributed much to the population of the city.&nbsp;
In 1574, Norwich exhibited on its muster roll 2120 able men,
towards the general defence against the invincible Armada.&nbsp;
In 1578, queen Elizabeth took up her abode for several days in
the city.&nbsp; In 1688, the charter was confirmed <!-- page
9--><a name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 9</span>to its
full extent, by virtue of which, the government is vested in a
mayor, recorder, steward, two sheriffs, twenty-four aldermen, of
which the mayor is one, sixty common councilmen, a town clerk,
chamberlain, sword bearer and other officers.</p>
<p>In 1556, the extent of Norwich was ascertained, by which it
appears to be 14 miles in circumference.&nbsp; Norwich first sent
members to parliament in 1264.&nbsp; In 1403, four citizens were
summoned to parliament, but as they were paid by the citizens
&pound;3 for their attendance, they petitioned sending only two
to save expence.&nbsp; The city at present sends two who are
chosen by the freeholders and freemen, some of whom are so by
inheritance, some by servitude, and others by purchase&mdash;the
sheriffs for the time being, are the returning officers.</p>
<p>Till within a few years, the population of Norwich had been
increasing, <i>viz.</i> from the year 1693 to 1786, as will
appear by the annexed parochial list; but this is owing
principally to strangers resorting to Norwich as a manufacturing
place, for by comparing, the births with the deaths within that
period, the latter have considerably exceeded the former.&nbsp;
The decrease in the population observable in the table since
1786, is 3197; but 1786 was a year of peace; and in 1801, those
serving in the army, navy, and militia, were not included; out of
the number of houses in 1801, there were 747 unoccupied, and of
the total number of persons, 21,044 were females, and 15,810
males, being nearly in proportion of 4 to 3.</p>
<p><!-- page 10--><a name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
10</span>At what period the art of manufacturing cloth from wool
was first introduced in this Island, is not certain; but it may
be supposed it was early practised in Norfolk, from the
circumstance of spinning with the distaff, being still retained
here.&nbsp; Before William the Conqueror woollen cloths were made
in Norwich; but what tended most to increase the Norwich worsted
manufactory, was the number of Flemish artizans who came over
here in 1336; and in the time of Richard the II. and succedings
reigns, various statutes were enacted for the encouragement and
regulation of the trade.&nbsp; In 1445 the trade had arrived to
such a degree of excellence, as to rival all other nations in the
foreign Markets.&nbsp; In Henry VIII&rsquo;s time, according to
Blomfield, the sale of stuffs made in Norwich only amounted
annually to &pound;200,000 besides hose which were computed at
&pound;60,000 more.&nbsp; During the reigns of Edward VI. and
Queen Mary, new articles of Manufactory continued to be
introduced, and new regulations made.&nbsp; In the time of Queen
Elizabeth, encouragement was given to the inhabitants of the low
Countries, under the persecution of the Duke of Alva, to settle
here; and they introduced a variety of new fabrications, by the
intermixture of silk and mohair and several new articles were
manufactured as various in their qualities as their names.&nbsp;
In 1575 Bombasines were first introduced, for the manufactory of
which elegant article, Norwich has ever since been famed, but
still the trade seemed confined principally to home consumption;
and the act of 1721, which prohibited <!-- page 11--><a
name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 11</span>the general
wearing of cottons, and the order for the Court Mourning to
consist of Norwich crapes, serve as proof that the trade did not
depend so much on foreign demand as home consumption.&nbsp; From
about, 1740 to 1760, the stuff trade gradually declined, and
through the prevalence of the India and Manchester cotton goods
the destruction of the home trade was almost completed.&nbsp; The
Manufacturers were obliged to extend their continental
connections, their travellers were seen in every kingdom in
Europe, and the great continental fairs were crouded with
purchasers for goods of Norwich manufactory.&nbsp; They also sent
their sons to be educated on the continent that by learning the
languages they might strengthen their connections; the taste and
habits of every country and clime were consulted.&nbsp; Hence
Norwich and the Country for many miles round, became crowded with
looms, and though Norfolk and Suffolk, were incessantly employed,
yet the produce was unequal to the demand.&nbsp; It became
necessary to import yarn, as well as wool, and the consumption of
bay yarn from Ireland was very great.&nbsp; The neighbouring
Counties and Scotland also contributed something
considerable.&nbsp; At this meridian of prosperity, the trade,
from the capriciousness of fashion, began again to decay, and the
disastrous war breaking out, dissolved its continental
connections, depressed the spirit of enterprise, and paralized
the hand of industry.</p>
<p>The author of the Tour through the Island of Great Britain, in
1724, gives a statement which was furnished by a manufacturer,
whereby <!-- page 12--><a name="page12"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 12</span>it appears 120,000 persons were
employed in the various branches of the Norwich
manufactory.&nbsp; Arthur Young considers the interval from the
year 1743, till the unfortunate dispute with the American
colonies, to have been a flourishing era; the number of looms
were then found to be 12,000, and it was calculated that each
loom, with its attendant preparation, produced work to the value
of &pound;100 per annum; and that every loom employed five hands
besides the weaver, in the various processes before and after the
weaving, so that the whole number of persons employed, many of
which were old women and children, amounted to 72,000, and the
money earned by them to &pound;1,200,000.</p>
<p>At present, the merchants being shut out of foreign markets by
war, and from our own by fashion, the number of hands employed
must be considerably reduced.&nbsp; The principal articles of
this manufactory, are bombazines and broad camblets, for the
latter, of which the East India Company, have annually given
large orders, and it is much to be lamented that the benefits,
which formerly accrued from this manufacture, should within the
last few years have been in a great measure dissipated by a
narrow jealousy and want of unanimity amongst the
manufacturers.&nbsp; This discordance has created a baneful
competition, for the favours of the East India Company, which are
consequently distributed, in the greatest proportion, to that
quarter, where the labours of the poor must necessarily be the
most depreciated.&nbsp; A good understanding between <!-- page
13--><a name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 13</span>them
would not only have preserved their consequence with the company,
but would certainly have rendered their connection with that body
much more advantageous, the Company finding their account in the
goods; and not being able to procure them at any other
market.&nbsp; However, during the failure of a continental trade,
it certainly is of considerable consequence to the city.&nbsp;
The wools of Lincolnshire and Leicestershire are chiefly
used.</p>
<p>To articles before mentioned, have been of late years added,
cottons, shawls and some other fancy goods, both of silk and
cotton; some of which are calculated for furniture, and some for
dress, and which for elegance, surpass any thing of the kind made
in the kingdom.&nbsp; Cotton thread lace is also made here, and
no inconsiderable quantity of hempen cloth.</p>
<p>The staple manufactory of Norwich, furnishes about fifty
distinct occupations from the shearer of the sheep to the mariner
who ships the goods.&nbsp; The earnings of the different artizens
are various&mdash;men from 6s. to 30s. per week; women from 5s.
to 15s. and children, by spinning, filling and tire drawing, from
1s. to 4s.</p>
<p>The combing of wool used to employ a great number of hands;
but since the invention of machines, their employ is in a great
measure superseded.</p>
<p>In the time of Edward III. it is recorded there were not less
than 76 places of Christian worship, besides a Jewish synagogue,
in Norwich&mdash;we shall now proceed to give a <!-- page 14--><a
name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 14</span>brief account
of some of these now remaining.</p>
<p>The foundation stone of the cathedral is recorded to have been
laid by bishop Herbert, in 1096, and it was not until the year
1430, the cloisters were completed.&nbsp; In 1361, the upper part
of the steeple was partly blown down by a hurrican, after which,
the present spire was built.&nbsp; About the year 1470, the stone
roof of the nave was constructed, and adorned with sculptures of
scripture history; and shortly after, the stone roof over the
choir was erected, and adorned in a similar manner; and about the
same time, the whole vaulting was covered with lead.&nbsp; In
1509, it was considerably injured by fire; in 1601, part of the
spire was struck down by lightning, but speedily repaired; it
again suffered considerably by the rebellion, in 1543; it was
completely repaired and beautified in 1763, and again in
1807.</p>
<p>The architecture is chiefly of the style, called Norman; the
columns and arches are exceedingly various in their size,
mouldings, and ornaments; the choir terminates with a
semicircular east end, over which, are curiously painted windows,
by Dean Lloyd&rsquo;s lady.&nbsp; The walls include various
chapels, and some courts belonging to the dean and chapter.&nbsp;
The extreme length of the building is 411 feet from east to west;
and the width from north to south, 191 feet; the height of the
spire and tower, 315 feet; the spire is ornamented with bold
crockets, 5 feet asunder, attached to and <!-- page 15--><a
name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 15</span>running up
the ribs at each angle, and is the highest in England, except
Salisbury.&nbsp; The cloisters are 174 feet square, with arched
openings or windows, looking inwards on all sides; the roof,
which is about 16 feet high, is ornamented with scripture
sculptures, which however, are much injured by accident and
time.&nbsp; The west front of the cathedral displays a large
central compartment, corresponding with the width and heigth of
the nave; also two lateral divisions corresponding with the side
aisles, the whole forming a very grand entrance.&nbsp; The
interior must be allowed to have a grand and solemn general
effect, and that the whole appears of an unusual, bold and
substantial stile.&nbsp; It is to be lamented that the fitting up
of the choirs serve to destroy part of the grandeur and
solemnity, and shuts out the sight from a general and
comprehensive view of the building.&nbsp; Within the church and
cloisters, still remain some curious memorials of the dead; but
the greater part are removed, like those to whom they belong, to
make room for others, or have fallen a sacrifice to the gradual
inroads of time.</p>
<p>The Bishop&rsquo;s Palace stands on the north side of the
cathedral, was erected in the year 1318, and was enlarged and
ornamented by several successive Bishops; it suffered greatly in
the rebellion, and it was with some difficulty made habitable; it
has been improving ever since, and is now made a tolerable neat
and convenient residence.</p>
<p>On the south side of the cathedral, formerly stood a priory,
occuping part of the space, <!-- page 16--><a
name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 16</span>now called
the Lower Close, and which was built as a residence for 60 monks,
who officiated in the cathedral.</p>
<p>In the year 1804, on pulling down the workhouse, which stood
at the entrance of the deanery, some curious ruins were
discovered, and the shafts of three massive pillars are still
left standing, as specimens of the architecture of the age in
which they were built.</p>
<p>At the west end stands the free school, formerly the
charnel-house&mdash;was built about the year 1316; the upper part
was appropriated for the residence of four officiating priests,
the part beneath was a vault used as a charnel house, which is
now rendered into cellars, and part of the building occupied by
the master of the school.&nbsp; The present portico is much more
modern than the other parts of the building.</p>
<p>Adjoining the free-school, stands Erpingham&rsquo;s gate, (it
having been built by Sir Thomas Erpingham as a penance) and is an
elegant specimen of the architecture of the time; it is much
enriched with columns, mouldings, and many small statutes in
canopied niches, in one of which, over the centre, is Sir Thomas
Erpingham kneeling, and in the act of prayer.</p>
<p>The gate called St. Ethelbert&rsquo;s gate, from a church
dedicated to that saint, having formerly occupied its scite, and
which appears to have been built prior to the cathedral, was
burnt down in the insurrection, in 1272; after which, the
citizens were compelled to build the present handsome gate with
the chapel over it: the front facing tombland was formerly richly
ornamented, but by modern innovation and <!-- page 17--><a
name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 17</span>repair, it is
deprived of all its beauty.&nbsp; The chapel was some years since
used as the bishop&rsquo;s registry, but has for the last ten
years been occupied as a weekly concert room, by a society of
gentlemen amateurs.</p>
<p>There are few churches after the cathedral which deserves
particular mention as architectural objects, their names may be
found in the list of population; however, we shall notice St.
Julian&rsquo;s church, being founded anterior to the conquest and
for its exhibiting some specimens of Saxon architecture.</p>
<p>St. Peter&rsquo;s Mancroft church, a handsome regular
building, and after the cathedral, superior in size and
architecture to any other; it stands on an elevated spot at the
south west corner of the market place.&nbsp; Blomfield states it
was finished in the year 1455; it consists of a square tower,
about 100 feet high, though evidently intended to have been much
higher, as appears by the double buttresses extending to the top,
and the thickness of the walls; it contains an excellent peal of
12 bells, by Messrs Pack and Chapman, in 1775; the tenor weighs
41cwt.&nbsp; they are acknowledged for general effect, to be the
first peal in the world&mdash;and the ringers are justly ranked
with the first in the kingdom.</p>
<p>The church is wholly covered with lead, and supported by two
rows of pillars remarkably neat and slender; the body of the
church, including the chancel, is 212 feet in length, and is 70
feet wide; on the north and south sides are entrance
porches.&nbsp; The altar is ornamented with a painting,
representing the deliverance <!-- page 18--><a
name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 18</span>of St. Peter
out of prison, was executed by Catton, and presented to the
parish by Alderman Starling, in the year 1768.&nbsp; Within the
church are some few sepulchral monuments worthy notice, and a
fine organ built in 1707.&nbsp; The plate and furniture of the
altar is very valuable, one cup weighing upwards of 46 ozs. very
beautifully chased with the story of Abigal bringing presents to
David, which was given to the church, by Sir Peter Gleane.</p>
<p>In the vestry is a neat old painted carving, in
alabaster.&nbsp; A very curious piece of tapastry, in high
presevation; there is also an octavo Bible, on vellum, written in
1340, and a folio manuscript much more ancient.</p>
<p>St. Laurance church occupies the spot, which at a remote
period, was the quay for landing all fish brought to Norwich; the
tythes of the fishery, which must have been considerable, were
granted to the abbey of St. Edmund&rsquo;s Bury, on condition
that the abbot would erect a church.&nbsp; The present church was
erected in 1472, at the expence of the monastery of St. Edmunds
Bury, aided by private benefactions; the tower is a bold square
building, 112 feet in height; over the west door are several
figures sculptured in stone.&nbsp; Previous to the civil war, the
church was highly decorated with various altars, tabernacles,
&amp;c. the window ornamented with glass, and, according to
Blomfield, in 1643, the communion rails were broken down, the
floor of the chancel taken up, and the stained glass
defaced.&nbsp; In the parish registry is this entry, &ldquo;laid
out to Goodman Perfett, for the putting out the <!-- page 19--><a
name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 19</span>superstitious
inscriptions in the church window, and the pulling down of
crucifixes 1s. 8d.&rdquo;&nbsp; In this church are several
monuments.</p>
<p>Norwich is much indebted to monachism for many charitable
institutions, among which, are the free Grammar School, before
mentioned, which was originally kept in the fratry of a
suppressed convent of friars; but afterwards the charnel house
was appropriated to that use, the houses of the chaplains being
fitted up for the Master, and the chaple for the school-room.</p>
<p>The master has &pound;50 per annum, and the house; it is also
endowed with scholarships and fellowships belonging to Caius
College, Cambridge.</p>
<p>Are here also five charity schools for boys, and one for
girls, which have been instituted more than a century, and are
supported by benefactions, annual subscriptions, annual
collections made at fourteen sermons, preached at different
parishes, by rents of two estates left by Alderman Riseborough,
the one situate in Walpole, and the other in Walton, in Norfolk,
and by dividends arising from funded property.&nbsp; The boys are
taught reading, writing and arithmetic, and the girls reading and
sewing, and both instructed in the religious duties according to
the Liturgy of the Church of England.</p>
<p>In the year 1784, labour was introduced and the boys and girls
went alternately to spinning and reading, &amp;c. but so
prejudiced were their parents against this plan, that the number
of children was reduced from 480 in 1784, to 188 in 1803.&nbsp;
At a special meeting held in 1803, <!-- page 20--><a
name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 20</span>the low stale
of the schools was taken into consideration; and the introduction
of labour being considered as the cause of it, the abandonment of
the spinning school was unanimously agreed; and the number from
that time has gradually increased.&nbsp; From the last state of
the charity, it appears that 46 boys are taught at each of the
schools, making a total of 230.</p>
<p>Since the publication of the last state, the girls school has
been established on the improved system of teaching, according to
the plan of Dr. Bell, and Mr. Lancaster; and 104 girls are taught
reading, writing, arithmetic, and sewing, at very little more
expence than formerly 40 were.&mdash;The Rev. C. J. Chapman,
Treasurer.</p>
<p>Each of the masters have a liberal salary, including house
rent and firing, and the governess of the girl&rsquo;s school has
similar advantages.&nbsp; The boys, in addition to their
learning, have a coat once a year, in February, and such books as
they want during their term, which is five years&mdash;the girls
are suitably allowed.</p>
<p>In addition to the above, are various parish Sunday schools,
where children of both sexes are instructed in the early
rudiments of education; also a school for 48 girls, where they
are taught reading, writing, sewing, and every other necessary
accomplishment, in the Bull-lane, St. Stephen&rsquo;s, which is
under the patronage, direction, and at the entire expence of Miss
Gurney.&nbsp; They attend church with the governess every Sunday,
and in addition to their learning, &amp;c. have each a hat, and
those whose parents are unable, are furnished with <!-- page
21--><a name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 21</span>other
articles of dress, to render their appearance suitable and
decent.</p>
<p>There is also a school belonging to the Unitarians; the
present master, Mr. Harwin, lives in the Rose-lane, King-street,
where 50 boys and girls are educated.</p>
<p>The Independents and other dissenters from the church,
contribute something towards the education of the children of
their respective persuasions; besides, a school for the education
of girls has been lately established by the dissenters, which is
supported by annual collections at the different meetings.&nbsp;
The school-room is in St. Paul&rsquo;s and the number educated is
120.</p>
<p>Of the hospitals, there were formerly one in St.
Edmund&rsquo;s, for 30 boys, who were clad in blue coats and red
caps, and altogether educated and maintained upon the foundation;
and one for 24 girls, who where clothed in blue gowns, and
educated and maintained upon the foundation.&nbsp; The original
plan of both these institutions is entirely altered, and they are
at present consolidated on the premises of the boy&rsquo;s
hospital, in St. Edmund&rsquo;s, were 40 boys, and 31 girls are
educated, and their parents allowed &pound;10. a year for their
maintenance, out of which, they pay for their
education.&mdash;The present master for the boys&rsquo;, Mr.
Gidney, and the governess of the girls&rsquo;, Mrs. Gidney.</p>
<p>St. Giles&rsquo; or the old Man&rsquo;s Hospital, in St.
Helen&rsquo;s parish, was founded 1249; and was originally
intended for men only; at present it maintains 53 men, and 53
women, including 6 nurses; any one before they can be admitted
<!-- page 22--><a name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
22</span>must be 60 years of age; are elected by a court of
mayoralty, and must carry with them, a featherbed, blankets, and
ten shillings for a coffin.</p>
<p>Doughty&rsquo;s hospital, in St. Saviour&rsquo;s parish, was
originally endowed for 24 poor men and 8 poor women, each being
60 years of age and upwards, having a room in the hospital,
partly furnished, with an allowance of two shillings a week, and
one chaldron of coals annually delivered them, at several stated
times, by the master, who must be a single man, has two rooms,
and double allowance; the men were also allowed a coat, and the
women a gown, every 2 years, of purple cloth; but the trustees
have been enabled to add sixpence per week, at several times, to
the original donation, in consequence of various benefactions
left of late years to the foundation; at present, the
establishment is for 28 men and 10 women, who have an allowance
of three shillings and sixpence weekly; the coals as heretofore,
and the coats and gowns changed to a pair of shoes, and a shirt
or a shift each annually.</p>
<p>Cooke&rsquo;s hospital, in the Rose-lane, St. Peter&rsquo;s
per Mountergate was endowed by Robert and Thomas Cooke, Esqrs.
for the habitation of 10 poor women being 60 years of age or
upwards, of good character, and who had been inhabitants of the
city at least 10 years.&nbsp; Each of them in addition to their
room are allowed thirteen shillings per quarter, and some who are
exceedingly needy, assisted with clothing.</p>
<p>The Norfolk and Norwich hospital was first opened for the
reception of patients, in 1772; <!-- page 23--><a
name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 23</span>it stands
about a quarter of a mile from the walls of the city on the
London road.&nbsp; Its front aspect is nearly south east; it is a
neat brick building, in the form of an H; it was erected and is
still supported by voluntary contributions, and cost upwards of
&pound;13,000.&nbsp; A new wing was added in 1802, which
completed the original plan.&nbsp; The governors meet every
Saturday at eleven o&rsquo;clock, to transact the business of the
hospital.&nbsp; It appears from an abstract of the register to
the end of the year 1808, a period of 36 years&mdash;there have
been on the admission list, 27,051 in and out patients, out of
which 17,727 have been discharged as cured; 3786 relieved; 3400
for non-attendance, and other irregularities; 640 incurable; 1292
died; and 206 remaining on the books, the number of patients have
been much increasing, as appears from the yearly statements.</p>
<p>Bethelham Hospital, or Bedlam, was founded in the year 1713,
for the reception of lunatics; for its endowment, the founder
settled by will, all her estates on a body of trustees, who were
to have the management of the house forever.&nbsp; As many poor
lunatics are kept here gratis, as the funds will allow&mdash;the
inhabitants of the city having the first claim; after which the
trustees have the power of selecting proper objects from any part
of the county; they may also admit others, while there is room,
whose friends will agree to pay the moderate allowance of four
shillings and sixpence per week.&nbsp; Additions were made to the
building in 1807.&nbsp; The number of objects are considerably
increased, <!-- page 24--><a name="page24"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 24</span>by the good management of the
trustees, and some late benefactions, and the funds are in a
thriving state.&nbsp; The master&rsquo;s salary is &pound;40
besides his dwelling, and two chaldron of coals
yearly.&mdash;There is also a private lunatic house, situate near
where brazen doors formerly stood.</p>
<p>The Norwich Dispensary, in Pottergate street, instituted in
1804, for the purpose of giving advice and medicine gratis to
such indigent poor of the city, as are unable to procure
assistance.&nbsp; Mr. Powel, the apothecary, has a liberal
salary, including house rent and taxes.&nbsp; The physicians
attend every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday Mornings, for the
examination and admission of patients.&nbsp; The number of
patients who have received the benefit of this institution, have
in the course of 12 months, amounted to near 600, of which the
greater part have been discharged cured.</p>
<p>The Infirmary in St. Augustine&rsquo;s parish, just outside
the city walls, was probably founded by a bishop of Norwich, as
an hospital for lepers, but is now occupied by ancient poor of
both sexes, who are past labor, and not fit to be put into common
workhouses; they are in wards from 8 to 12 in each ward, and have
every necessary, both of food and raiment; the number entertained
here is 103, and as soon as one dies, the vacancy is filled up by
election of the committee of the court of guardians for the
poor.&nbsp; The master has a good house on the premises, and a
liberal salary.</p>
<p>The hospital for indigent blind of Norfolk and Norwich, was
instituted in 1805, and in the <!-- page 25--><a
name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 25</span>month of
October, various pupils were admitted.&nbsp; It is principally
indebted to Thomas Tawell Esq. who purchased a very handsome
house, with upwards of 3 acres of ground, in Magdalen-street,
which he contributed for the use of the establishment, and
applied it as an asylum for aged blind persons, and a school for
the instruction of the young, in manufacturing articles, by which
they may obtain a livelihood; there are now 5 aged persons and 16
pupils.&nbsp; The annual subscriptions already raised for its
support, amount to about &pound;400, and the benefactions to
nearly &pound;1000.</p>
<p>The Humane Society for the recovery of persons apparently
drowned, paid from June 1807, to June 1809, &pound;5. 8s. 6d. for
assistance given to 18 objects who were in danger of being
drowned&mdash;The Mayor of Norwich, for the time being, is
Treasurer.</p>
<p>The Friars&rsquo; Society, for the participation of useful
knowledge, instituted in 1785; their rooms for meeting are in
Crown-Court, Elm Hill.&nbsp; Their principal is an abbot, who has
a prior and other officers under him; they, during the winter
season, distribute soup and bread to a great number of the poor
in Norwich.</p>
<p>The Friendly Society, for the benefit of poor women in
sickness and old age, was instituted in April, 1802, and consists
of subscribing and recommended members.&nbsp; A subscribing
member pays on admission 5s. 6d. and 7s. 6d. annually, which
enables her to recommend one poor woman under 45 years of
age.&nbsp; A benefactor of five guineas has the same
privilege.</p>
<p>A recommended member pays 2s. 9d. on <!-- page 26--><a
name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 26</span>admission,
and 6&frac12;d. on the first Monday of every calendar month,
which after one year entitles her to 5s. per week during her
confinement in child-bed, for one month, and 2s. 6d. per week
afterwards, if confined by consequent illness; and during any
other sickness or misfortune, 3s. 6d. per week for one month, and
2s. 6d. per week afterwards; at the death of her husband
&pound;1; and 5s. for each of her children under 14 years of
age.</p>
<p>At the age of 60 years, a recommended member ceases to pay her
monthly subscriptions, and is entitled to an annuity of &pound;2.
12s. for life, or to such other annuity as the funds of the
society are judged capable of paying.</p>
<p>This society from its institution, to April, 1809, has paid
&pound;613. 11s. 6d. to 760 women; to 308 during confinement in
child-bed; 438 during sickness; and to 14 losing their
husbands.&nbsp; Treasurer, the Rev. C. J. Chapman Secretary, Mr.
J. English.</p>
<p>Charity for Clergymen&rsquo;s widows, &amp;c. in Norwich and
Norfolk.&nbsp; President, the Lord Bishop of Norwich for the time
being Treasurer, the Rev. Mr. Parr.</p>
<p>The Norfolk Dissenters&rsquo; Benevolent Association, for the
relief of aged dissenting Ministers, their widows and orphans, is
supported by voluntary subscriptions among the Calvinistic
Unitarian, and Baptist Dissenters; and an annual collection, in
aid of the funds, is made at every meeting of the above
persuasions in the county.&nbsp; The annual meeting of the
society is held the first week in May.&nbsp; J. Barnard, Esq. of
Knapton, Treasurer.</p>
<p><!-- page 27--><a name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
27</span>The Benevolent Association, for the relief of decayed
tradesmen&rsquo;s windows, and orphans; was instituted in
1790.&nbsp; From the statement of the society, it appears that
near 700 tradesmen&rsquo;s widows and orphans have already
received benefit from the funds of the association; and that the
accumulating fund of the society from benefactions, &amp;c.
amount to nearly &pound;3000.&nbsp; Mr. C. Bagg, Clerk.</p>
<p>The Norfolk Benevolent Medical Society, for raising and
establishing a fund for the relief and benefit of widows and
children of surgeons and apothecaries, and of indigent members of
the profession, in Norfolk and Norwich, instituted in 1786.&nbsp;
This society holds a general meeting yearly, in May, at Norwich
and Swaffham, alternately.</p>
<p>The Society of Universal Goodwill, in Norwich, for the relief
of foreigners who are not entitled to assistance from the parish
laws of this country.&nbsp; The number of persons who have been
relieved by this society, amounts to near 3000.</p>
<p>The Amicable Society for Attornies, for raising and
establishing a fund for the relief and benefit of the widows and
children of Attornies in Norfolk and Norwich, instituted
1784.&nbsp; Subscribers pay one guinea annually, and they have
accumulated a fund of upwards &pound;2000.&nbsp; Meetings of the
society are held at the White Swan, St. Peter&rsquo;s, on the
first Monday in April and October.</p>
<p>Besides the preceding, here are some other public, and many
private charities and benefactions, which, together with those
already <!-- page 28--><a name="page28"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 28</span>enumerated, serve to shew that the
spirit of beneficence is not fled, nor the hand of liberality
closed.</p>
<p>Formerly, here were two workhouses for the poor, one the Duke
of Norfolk&rsquo;s Palace, hired by the Court of him for that
purpose, and within these few year, pulled down; the other in St.
Andrew&rsquo;s, adjoining the Hall, which is the only place
occupied for that purpose at present.</p>
<p>The annual expence of maintaining the poor of Norwich, has
amounted to &pound;20,000 on an average for the last 20 years,
which has been raised by an assessment on the half rental of
occupations, at about 5s. on the pound quarterly.</p>
<p>The workhouses falling to decay; inconvenient, unhealthy, and
unnecessarily expensive; an act was obtained, in 1802, for
building a new workhouse, without side the city walls, capable of
containing 1300 persons.&nbsp; Seven acres and a half of land was
purchased for this purpose, in a healthy situation, near
Chapel-field; but, after many meetings, and various plans and
estimates offered, it was determined not to build a new house,
but to enlarge and completely repair the old one in St.
Andrew&rsquo;s, some adjoining buildings were accordingly
purchased, the whole new modelled, and made convenient and
comfortable for 600 people, and if necessary, room can be made
for 200 more.</p>
<p>Bridewell is in the Mayor&rsquo;s jurisdiction for the
confinment of such as commit petty offences or outrages in the
city, is situated in St. Andrew&rsquo;s parish.&nbsp; The north
wall of which is <!-- page 29--><a name="page29"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 29</span>about 79 feet in length, by 27 in
height, and is considered one of the greatest curiosities of the
kind in the kingdom; it is incrusted with flints squared to about
three inches each, and cut to so great a nicety, that the edge of
a knife can scarcely be insinuated between the joints; it appears
as regular and smooth as brick-work; it was built about the year
1370, and seems to have sustained little or no injury by time or
accident, although the other parts of the building have been
twice nearly consumed by fire.&nbsp; There are some other pieces
of flint-work in the city, equally well executed, particularly on
the south side of St. Michael&rsquo;s Coslany church.&nbsp; The
art of squaring flints appears to have been lost in England, but
some works executed in that way within the last century in
France, prove the art is in some measure recovered there.</p>
<p>The City Gaol, till the year 1597, occupied the east end of
Guild-hall, at which time it was removed to its present
situation, opposite the Guild-hall in the market, and had, until
that time been a public inn, called the Lamb, which was purchased
by St. George&rsquo;s company, to be converted to its present
use.</p>
<p>The Guild-hall was originally a small thatched building, and
in Edward the third&rsquo;s time, was called a toll-booth; about
the same time, a small room was added, from which it acquired the
name of the Guild-hall, and continued in this state till Henry
the Fourth in 1406, granted the city, a charter for electing a
Mayor, &amp;c., at which time, a committee was formed, and a
warrant granted them to raise money, and press <!-- page 30--><a
name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 30</span>all workmen
for the erecting of a new Guild-hall, which business was so
vigorously pursued, that in 1409, the roof was raised; in 1511
part of the roof at the east end fell down, and in 1635 it was
near being demolished by the deputes&rsquo; servants undermining
its foundation in digging for saltpetre.&nbsp; The windows of the
Council chamber were formerly of painted and stained glass, which
have been miserably mutilated.&mdash;This room is ornamented with
portraits of various eminent persons, and also the arms of the
great Norfolk hero, the late Lord Nelson, with the sword of the
Spanish Admiral, taken by his Lordship in 1797, and presented by
him to the Corporation.</p>
<p>The Common-council-chamber underwent a complete repair in
1806, at which time it was considerably enlarged: in this Hall
the Assizes, and quarter Sessions, for the city, are held.&nbsp;
It contains also the Mayor&rsquo;s office for transacting daily
business, the Town-clerk&rsquo;s and Chamberlain&rsquo;s offices;
and all elections for Majors and other officers, and all
questions of moment relative to the city, are here
determined.</p>
<p>St. Andrew&rsquo;s hall, is a noble fabric, and was formerly a
conventual church of Benedictine friars, it was founded in 1415,
consists of a nave and two aisles, which remain nearly perfect;
it had formerly a handsome steeple, which fell down in 1712; the
aisles are separated from the nave by six elegant slender colomns
which support the roof, they are half the width of the nave, and
the same length, the whole is 120 feet long, and seventy wide;
within the walls there are 45 windows, most of which were
formerly <!-- page 31--><a name="page31"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 31</span>ornamented with painted glass, which
is chiefly removed or demolished.&nbsp; In the time of Henry the
Eighth, through the interest of the Duke of Norfolk, the citizens
obtained leave to make of the church, a fair and large hall for
the Mayor, &amp;c. to repair unto at a common assembly,
&amp;c.</p>
<p>The St. George&rsquo;s Company formerly held their feasts and
meetings here.&nbsp; This fraternity took its rise in 1385, and
at one time amounted to 240 members; in 1416, they received a
charter of incorporation: in 1731, the company resigned their
charter into the hands of the Corporation; their plate and
paraphernalia were sold, their debts paid, and their meetings
entirely ceased.&nbsp; In 1544, the first Mayor&rsquo;s feast was
held here, and in 1561, a sumptuous dinner, was given to the Duke
of Norfolk, and a numerous assembly of nobility and gentry, at
which the Mayor&rsquo;s portion of the expence, amounted to
&pound;l. 12s. 9d.&nbsp; The bill of fare exhibits a striking
difference between the price of provisions at that period and the
present, beef being 1s. 6d. per stone, flour 6d. per bushel, and
double strong beer 2s. 6d. per barrel.&nbsp; King Charles the
Second, and many of the nobility, were entertained here in
1671.&nbsp; In 1774, this building, underwent alterations, and
received some additions, among which were the present porch, and
the room over it, fitted up as the City Library, in which the
Court of Requests for the recovery of small debts, is held.&nbsp;
In 1796, the hall was opened as a Corn-Exchange for which purpose
it is used every Saturday.&nbsp; It was new painted, and the
pictures cleaned in 1806.&nbsp; The walls are decorated with
numerous <!-- page 32--><a name="page32"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 32</span>portraits of those who from official
situations or otherwise, have contributed to the welfare of the
city, among which, at the upper end is an admirable portrait of
the immortal Nelson, being the last, and it is considered the
best for which he ever sat.&nbsp; It was painted by Sir Wm.
Beechey, in 1801.&nbsp; Also, two fine historical paintings by
Wm. Martin, of Edward and Eleanora, and the death of Lady Jane
Gray, which he presented to his native city.&nbsp; At the lower
end over the window is displayed, the ensign of the French ship,
La Genereux, captured by Sir Edward Berry, in 1800.&nbsp; Every
satisfactory particular, relative to this place, the pictures,
artists, &amp;c. may be learned from a late publication, &ldquo;A
Companion to St. Andrew&rsquo;s Hall, Price, 1s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There is also a Jew&rsquo;s synagogue in St. Peter&rsquo;s
Mancroft; two Catholic meetings, one in St. John&rsquo;s
Maddermarket, erected within the last thirty years, the other in
St. Swithins lane, of longer standing, and much smaller.&nbsp; A
French church in Queen-street, near Tombland, and the Dutch
church, so called, from having been formerly used by a Dutch
congregation adjoining St. Andrew&rsquo;s hall, but which is now
used for the poor belonging to the workhouse.&nbsp; Two
Quakers&rsquo; meetings, one of which is in St. Augustine&rsquo;s
Parish, on the south side the Gildencraft, which is a strong
brick building with a large burying-ground; the other in the
Goat-lane, near the market-place, which is much smaller and more
generally attended.&nbsp; There are several other places of
worship, used by the Protestant Dissenters, of which, that
belonging <!-- page 33--><a name="page33"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 33</span>to the Unitarians is by far the most
elegant.&nbsp; It is an octangular building supported within-side
by eight elegant Corinthian Pillars.&nbsp; The pews are wainscot,
the cieling is an ornamented dome, and the effect of the whole,
is remarkably striking.&nbsp; The first stone of the Building was
laid, by the celebrated Dr. Taylor, on the 25th of February,
1754.&nbsp; The expence of the building which was near
&pound;5000. was defrayed by the congregation, who can number
among their Ministers, several of great literay celebrity, in
particular Dr. John Taylor, Dr. Enfieid, Mr. Bourne, and Mr.
George Morgan.</p>
<p>The Independents&rsquo; meeting-house, stands a little to the
east of the foregoing, in the parish of St. Clement&rsquo;s: it
is a large handsome square building, and was finished about
1693.&nbsp; The limits of this design will not admit of a
particular enumeration of all the places of worship, belonging to
the various congregations of Anabaptists, Methodists, &amp;c. of
which there are many, chiefly in the northern part of the
city.</p>

branching upon the London road, arrive and are dispatched at the
same time every day.&nbsp; The Mail to Yarmouth, is dispatched

<p>Norwich market has for a long series of years, been held in
the highest estimation, for the quantity and quality of
provisions, with which it has been supplied, particularly for
poultry, which are sent from hence, in considerable quantities to
London, and various other parts of the kingdom.&nbsp; The market
is under the regulation of a Committee from the Court of
Aldermen, and Commons.&nbsp; Market-days, Wednesday and
Saturday.&nbsp; Collector of the market, Mr. R. Harmar.&nbsp; The
Fish-market, adjoining, is generally well supplied (from
Yarmouth) daily, as is the butchery, with beef and mutton.</p>
<p>The Norwich cattle-market, held on the castle meadow, every
Saturday, has for many years been increasing, and is considered
at this time, the first cattle-market in the kingdom, out of the
metropolis.&nbsp; The Corporation, at an Assembly held in
September, 1809, ordered pens to be erected for pigs and sheep,
more convenient places to be assigned for beasts, horses, stalls,
waggons, carts, &amp;c.; and tolls were ordered to be collected,
viz. for pigs and sheep, 8d. <!-- page 35--><a

beasts, when sold 2d. each, by the purchaser; for horses, 6d.
each; for waggons, brought for sale, 1s. each; for stalls, 6d.
each; for every auction, 1s.; for calves and mules, 1d.
each.&nbsp; Here also is the weighbridge for Hay, &amp;c., Mr. C.
Hubbard, hay-weigher, and collector of the cattle-market.</p>
<p>Norwich Public Library, was instituted in 1784, and was held
in the City Library-room adjoining St. Andrew&rsquo;s hall, till
1794, when it was removed to the building formerly the catholic
chapel, Wymer-street, where books are delivered by the librarian
to the subscribers, every day, between the hours of eleven and
two, Sundays and a few holidays excepted.&nbsp; It contains
upwards of 7000 volumes.&nbsp; Every subscriber pays two guineas
and a half, on his admission, and an additional half-guinea,
annually.&nbsp; There are about 500 subscribers, under the
regulation of a President, Vice-president, and a Committee of 24,
chosen from their body, half at each of their annual meetings for
two years.&nbsp; A meeting of the Committee, is held on the
second Monday of every month, and the annual meeting, the first
week in September.</p>
<p>The Assembly-rooms, usually called Chapel-field-house, where
assemblies, &amp;c. are held, built in 1754.&nbsp; The rooms are
spacious and brilliant.</p>
<p>The Theatre was built in 1757, and much enlarged, and improved
by the present Patentee, W. Wilkins, Esq. in 1800, at which time,
distinct entrances were made to each part of the house; it is
convenient, and tastefully fitted up.&nbsp; <!-- page 36--><a
name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 36</span>It contains
two circles of boxes, besides those above which range with the
gallery.&nbsp; The box-lobbies are commodious, and at the back of
the upper-circle, is a bar-room, where refreshments of every kind
may be procured.&nbsp; The stage is large, and the house has
every necessary convenience of green-room, dressings-rooms,
scene-rooms, painters-room, property-rooms, music-room,
carpenter&rsquo;s shop, several rooms occupied by the person who
keeps the house, &amp;c.&nbsp; It will conveniently hold
&pound;130. and has been a nursery for many performers of
celebrity, who have afterwards become favorites in the
metropolitan theatres, among whom where Mr. Murray, Harley, C.
Bannister, Powell, Townshend, Waddy, Blanchard, &amp;c.&nbsp; The
house when well filled, appears to the best advantage, and then
any person who has a taste for theatrical amusements, neatness
and elegance, cannot fail being agreeably entertained with the
appearance of the audience, the performers and the house.</p>
<p>The principal place of Summer-amusement and resort, is
Ranelagh garden, just without side the City walls, on the London
road.&nbsp; Here is a large octangular building, the Pantheon,
which is 70 feet in diameter and is fitted up with two tier of
boxes, for the reception of company, and an orchestra with rooms
behind, for the accommodation of the musicians, leaving a large
area in the middle; it is capable of conveniently holding 1200
persons, and here on some public occasions, and annually in the
Assize week, which in the regular way commences on the Monday,
eight <!-- page 37--><a name="page37"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 37</span>weeks after Trinity Sunday; the
proprietor entertains the public with some of the principal vocal
performers from the London theatres, and a suitable band.&nbsp;
In the garden is also a bowling-green and an orchestra for the
reception of a military band, and the garden and pantheon on this
occasion is elegantly lighted up with thirty thousand lamps, in a
style superior to any thing of the kind out of the metropolis;
the pantheon is at other times occasionally used for very large
dinner parties, and for the exhibition of performances, for which
the theatre is not adapted.&nbsp; The area is sometimes fitted up
as a circus for equestrian exhibitions, for which it is better
calculated than any place in the kingdom, out of London.</p>
<p>A garden and bowling-green, called Norwich Vauxhall, in
Barrack-street, Pockthorpe, very pleasantly situated against the
navigable river from Yarmouth; it is on a smaller scale than
Ranelagh, is well furnished with boxes for company, and was
tolerably frequented for two or three seasons after it was
enlarged and fitted up in its present manner, but has been
gradually falling in public estimation since, notwithstanding the
proprietor has at several times brought forward a variety of
amusements: and indeed it is not probable his exertions can be
productive, its situation precluding it from a share of public
favor.</p>
<p>The bowling-green near chapel-field, is much the largest in or
near Norwich, and is well frequented by the tradesmen in the
neighbourhood, and strangers, during the summer season.</p>
<p><!-- page 38--><a name="page38"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
38</span>The Adam and Eve garden, in St. Martin&rsquo;s palace,
near the cathedral, is a pleasant rural spot, on the opposite
side of the river to Vauxhall, it has a good prospect of the
horse-barracks, and in the summer seasons is very well
frequented.</p>
<p>At Bracondale and Carrow, are some pleasant gardens,
commanding a beautiful general prospect, particularly towards
Thorpe, over the river.</p>
<p>The village of Thorpe is delightfully situated on the
navigable river to Yarmouth, and commands a charming prospect;
here are several places of public resort which are well
frequented during the summer season.</p>
<p>Chapel-field, which is on the south-west part of Norwich, was
formerly a place of much resort as a promenade, particularly on
Sunday afternoons; but within the last few years a reservoir has
been made, and a large tower built, which by a steam engine, at
the New Mills, (which were first erected in 1430, improved in
1695, and brought to perfection in 1802,) and a subteraneous
conveyance, is constantly suplied with water, some of which is by
machinery conveyed from the reservoir to the tower, for the
supply of such parts of the city as are above the level of the
reservoir, from whence it is distributed by cylinders and pipes
of different materials.&nbsp; The reservoir and tower have
however, in some degree, spoil&rsquo;d its appearance, and
together with military parades being generally in the Market, or
on the Castle-hill, and Meadow, have occasioned those places to
become the principal promenades.</p>
<p><!-- page 39--><a name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
39</span>The horse-barracks, about a quarter of a mile north-east
of the City, were erected in 1792, and are well worth the
observation of a stranger; they are capable of holding about 230
horses and men; the foot barracks, just on the northern side of
Coslany-bridge, are calculated to contain about 740 men.</p>
<p>There are five public bridges over the river Wensum, besides
one at the New Mills, generally used by sufferance, which is of
wood; four of the others, viz.&mdash;Blackfriars&rsquo;,
Fye-bridge, Whitefriars, and Bishop-bridge, of stone, and Coslany
of iron.</p>
<p>Among the miscellaneous buildings, &amp;c. worthy the
attention of the antiquarian or stranger, is Kett&rsquo;s castle,
so called from the famous Norfolk rebel of that name, who
encamped there in 1549, at the head of 20,000 insurgents, whose
numbers were continually increasing.&nbsp; From this place he
attacked the city, where he committed every kind of outrage,
wantonly destroying many of the principal inhabitants, merely
because they were gentlemen, and burning and plundering most part
of the city and country adjacent.&nbsp; Every possible means were
used by government to disperse them by lenient means in vain;
after which, a sufficient military force was sent to subdue them,
which was not effected till many battles and skirmishes had taken
place, with great slaughter to the insurgents, and some loss to
the army.&nbsp; After the main body were subdued, pardon was
again offered to a smaller party who remained in reserve, and who
presently complying with the offer, and with one voice cried out
&ldquo;<i>God save King Edward</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 40--><a name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
40</span>Kett and his brother were soon taken and committed to
the Tower of London, where they were tried and convicted of high
treason, and shortly after executed on gibbets, and hung in
chains, one on the top of Norwich castle, the other upon
Wymondham steeple, Wymondham being the place of their nativity,
and nearly three hundred others of the ringleaders
suffered.&nbsp; It is computed that Kett&rsquo;s rebellion cost
the nation at that time near &pound;20,000.&nbsp; This Castle was
founded by Bishop Herbert, about seven hundred years since, as a
Chapel dedicated to St. Michael, some small ruins of which are
yet standing: it is situate on the brow of Mousehold hill, just
over Bishop bridge, near to which, close by the river on the left
hand, flows a spring of pleasant water, formerly much resorted
to, and over which was erected a handsome freestone conduit, by
Sir John Pettus, in 1611.&nbsp; A little further to the left, on
the other side of the river, stands the tower in the Hospital
meadow, called the Dungeon, or Cow&rsquo;s tower; it is a
circular building, about fifty two feet in height, and twenty
four in diameter, with a round spiral staircase reaching to the
top; is supposed to have been originally built as an advanced
post and watch tower to the castle; Blomfield thinks it was built
in order to levy the tolls then belonging to the prior and the
church, and says it was used as a prison for the jurisdiction of
the Cathedral.&nbsp; The present tower is stated to have been
built in 1390, at the expence of the city.</p>
<p>In St. James&rsquo;s parish, opposite the church, is an old
house, said to have been built by the celebrated Sir John
Fastolf, and termed in antient records his palace, or city
house.</p>
<p><!-- page 41--><a name="page41"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
41</span>Just within side of the walls near Ber-street, stands
St. Catherine&rsquo;s hill, on which is Mrs. Burroughes&rsquo;s
house, the sight of which will well repay the trouble of a
walk.&nbsp; The buildings in Surry-street, among which is
Surry-house, a curious specimen of domestic architecture, the
windows of which were emblazoned on glass, with many armorial
bearings.&nbsp; There are also a number of good houses in St.
Giles&rsquo;s-street, Messrs. Gurneys&rsquo; Bank, in St.
Michael&rsquo;s Plea; the Flour mill, by steam, in St.
Andrew&rsquo;s; Mr. Patteson&rsquo;s brewery, in Pockthorpe, and
many others, which will arrest the attention of the stranger in
his perambulation about the city.</p>
<p>Norwich, including the Hamlets, is divided into four great
wards, viz.&mdash;<i>Conisford ward</i>, <i>Mancroft ward</i>,
<i>Wymer ward</i>, and <i>Great Northern ward</i>; each of which
is again subdivided into three small wards; <i>Great
Conisford</i> containing <i>South Conisford ward</i>, in which is
comprized the parishes of St. Peter per Southgate, St. Etheldred
and St. Julian, and the hamlets of Trowse-milgate and Carrow;
<i>North Conisford ward</i>, in which is the parish of St. Peter
per Mountergate.&nbsp; <i>Ber-street ward</i>, in which are the
parishes of St. John at Sepulchre, St. Michael thorn, St. John
Timber-hill, All Saints, and the Hamlet of Lakenham.&nbsp;
<i>Great Mancroft ward</i> contains the Parishes of St. Stephen,
St. Peter per Mancroft, and St. Giles, each parish being a small
ward in itself, including the hamlets of Eaton, and part of
Earlham and Heigham.</p>
<p><!-- page 42--><a name="page42"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
42</span><i>Great Wymer ward</i>, is subdivided into three small
wards, viz.&mdash;<i>West Wymer ward</i>, contains the parishes
of St. Benedict, St. Swithin, St. Margaret, St. Lawrence and St.
Gregory, with part of the hamlets of Earlham and Heigham.&nbsp;
<i>Middle Wymer ward</i>, contains the Parishes of St. John at
Madder-market, St. Andrew and St Michael at Plea.&nbsp; <i>East
Wymer ward</i>, contains the parishes of St. Peter at Hungate,
St. Simon and Jude, St. George Tombland, St. Martin at the
Palace, and St. Helen.</p>
<p><i>Great Northern ward</i>, subdivided into three small wards,
viz.&mdash;<i>Coslany ward</i> contains the parishes of St.
Michael, St. Mary and St. Martin.&nbsp; <i>Colegate ward</i>
contains the parishes of St. George&rsquo;s Colegate, and St.
Augustine.&nbsp; <i>Fye Bridge ward</i> includes the parishes of
St. Edmund, St. James, St. Paul, St. Saviour, and St.
Clement.&nbsp; Each of the small wards have the right of electing
two Aldermen, and one of the Nominees for the Common Council; the
rest of the Common Council being chosen by the Nominees.&nbsp;
<i>Great Conisford ward</i>, including the Nominees, choosing
twelve,&mdash;<i>Great Mancroft ward</i> sixteen,&mdash;<i>Great
Wymer ward</i> twenty,&mdash;and the <i>Northern ward</i>
twelve.&nbsp; In ward elections the resident freemen only have at
right to vote, and the election for Nominees takes place on the
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday, before
passion-week.</p>
<p>The City is governed by a Mayor, Recorder, Steward, two
Sheriffs, twenty-four Aldermen, (of which the Mayor is one,)
sixty Common Council-men, a Town-clerk, Chamberlain and
Sword-bearer, attended by suitable officers.</p>
<p><!-- page 43--><a name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
43</span>The Mayor is elected by the freemen, on the first day of
May, and sworn into office on the guild-day, which is on the
Tuesday before Midsummer, except Midsummer-day fall on a
Wednesday, in which case the guild is kept the Tuesday
se&rsquo;nnight before the Mayor is chosen from among the
Aldermen, is a Justice of the quorum during his mayoralty, and
afterwards Justice of the peace.</p>
<p>On the death or resignation of an Alderman, the Mayor on
receiving notice thereof, must within five days, and not less
than two; and giving not less than twenty-four hours notice to
the freemen in the great ward, in which the small ward belongs,
to elect another.</p>
<p>The Sheriffs are chosen&mdash;one by a letter from the court
of Aldermen, in the early part of July, and returnable if a full
assembly can be made, within fourteen days, upon paying a fine of
&pound;80 to the corporation, till the 10th of August; on which
day, whoever holds it must serve the office.&nbsp; The other
Sheriff is elected by the freemen on the last Tuesday in August,
and they are both sworn into office on Michaelmas-day.&nbsp; The
Mayor with the Sheriffs, hold courts every Wednesday and
Saturday, to hear complaints, and to do every other act tending
to the peaceable government of the city.</p>
<p>The Recorder assists in the Mayor&rsquo;s court as chief
Judge, as does the Steward in the Sheriffs&rsquo; court, they
must both be barristers, and are always Justices of the quorum,
and Council for the city.</p>
<p>The quarterly assemblies are held on February the
twenty-fourth, May the third, the day before guild-day, and Sept.
the twenty-first.</p>
<p><!-- page 44--><a name="page44"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
44</span>There are three Fairs in Norwich,&mdash;one on the
Thursday before Easter, on Tombland;&mdash;one on Easter-Monday
and Tuesday;&mdash;and one on Whit-Monday and Tuesday, by
Bishop-bridge.</p>
<p>Here are several Insurance-offices, viz.&mdash;The Norwich
Insurance Fire-ffice, on Orford hill, opened in November
1792.</p>
<p>The Union office for insurance against loss by fire, corner of
Briggs&rsquo;s lane, near the market, established in March
1797;&mdash;and at the same place The Union office, for the
insurance of lives, and granting Annuities and Endowments for
children.</p>
<p>The General Equitable assurance office, for insuring property
from fire, in Bank street, established Michaelmas, 1807.&nbsp;
The Anchor fire office, Back of the inns, established in June
1808; besides various agencies, viz.&mdash;</p>
<p>Sun fire office agent, Mr. John Taylor, <i>St.
Andrew&rsquo;s</i>;&mdash;Royal Exchange, Mr. J. Woodrow, <i>St.
George&rsquo;s Colegate</i>;&mdash;Ph&oelig;nix, Mr. H. Francis,
<i>Surry street</i>;&mdash;Suffolk, Mr. Marsh, <i>Bank
street</i>;&mdash;British, Mr. L. F. Boyce, <i>St. John&rsquo;s
Maddermarket</i>;&mdash;Imperial, Mr. Charles Norton, <i>King
street</i>.</p>
<p>A gentleman desirous of spending a few days in Norwich, cannot
help being gratified by seeing the various employments of its
extensive manufactories in Stuffs, Cottons, Shawls
&amp;c.&mdash;the first and last of which are here carried to a
perfection no where else to be met with in England.</p>
<p>Norwich adds greatly to the trade of Yarmouth, by the
importation of about 40,000 <!-- page 45--><a
name="page45"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 45</span>chaldrons of
coals yearly; wine, fish, oil, Irish yarn, and all heavy goods
which come from thence by the river Yare: and in Peace the
exportation of its manufactures to Russia, Germany, Holland,
Denmark, Norway, Spain, Portugal, Italy, &amp;c.&nbsp; The keels
and wherries which navigate between Norwich and Yarmouth are
acknowledged to be superior to any other small craft in England,
for carrying a larger burthen, and being worked at a smaller
expence;&mdash;their burthen is from fifteen to fifty tons; they
have but one mast, which lets down, and carry only one large
square sail, are covered close by hatches, and have a cabin
superior to many coasting vessels, in which oftentimes the
keelman and his family live; they require only two persons to
navigate them, and sometimes perform their passage (thirty-two
miles) in five hours.</p>
<p>Norwich has experienced of late years, a number of
improvements; the lighting is much more brilliant, and better
regulated than formerly; the paving also, which is in great
forwardness, and the alterations consequent thereon, have already
much improved many parts, and will when finished, add greatly to
the beauty of the city, and to the convenience and comfort of the
inhabitants and occasional visitors.&nbsp; The act for paving the
streets, &amp;c. was obtained in June 1808, and empowers the
commissioners to levy on all houses laid to the poor-rate, four
shillings in the pound on the half-rental, and one shilling and
four pence in the pounds on such houses &amp;c. as do not pay to
the poor-rate, computed on half their annual value; <!-- page
46--><a name="page46"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 46</span>also
by a frontage of two-pence per running foot.&nbsp; The
commissioners under the paving act are one hundred and thirty-six
in number; sixty-three permanent, besides the Mayor, Aldermen,
Sheriffs, Recorder, Steward, the Speaker of the Commons, the Rev.
the Dean and Prebendary, in all thirty-one, and forty-two
Parochial Commissioners, chosen annually.&nbsp; Clerk&rsquo;s
office on Elm-hill, there are also a surveyor and four collectors
of the rates.</p>
<p>Among the modern institutions of the city is one which serves
to shew that the fine arts are encouraged even at this distance
from the metropolis; this is a &ldquo;<i>Society of
Artists</i>,&rdquo; the members of which have made an annual
public exhibition of their pictures, for the last few years,
during the Assize and following week, at their room in Sir
Benjamin Wrenche&rsquo;s court, St. John&rsquo;s Maddermarket,
where they also hold a meeting once a fortnight.&nbsp; If
societies of this kind were more encouraged, instead of that
deformity, which disgraces many modern alterations, beauty,
consistency, and propriety would be introduced.</p>
<p>Two mail coaches run daily between London and Norwich; a
double bodied coach, called the Expedition, by Newmarket daily,
and a post coach by Bury three times a week;&mdash;they all leave
Norwich in the afternoon, and arrive in London the following
morning.&nbsp; A Lynn and Norwich Expedition by Dereham and
Swaffham, leave Norwich on Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday morning
at seven o&rsquo;clock, and arrive at Lynn the same evening,
returning <!-- page 47--><a name="page47"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 47</span>to Norwich on Wednesday, Friday and
Monday, in winter time it runs only twice a week, viz. on
Tuesdays and Saturdays.</p>
<p>A Machine to Yarmouth twice every day, from the Black horse,
Tombland, at eight o&rsquo;clock in the morning and four in the
afternoon, in the summer, and nine o&rsquo;clock in the morning
and three in the afternoon in winter, Saturday mornings excepted;
and in the worst part of the winter it sometimes runs only once
each day.</p>
<p>Two London waggons leave Norwich every Tuesday and Friday
evening, and return to Norwich every Wednesday and Saturday
sen&rsquo;-night following.&nbsp; By these waggons through
Cambridge, there is a regular conveyance to Manchester,
Birmingham, Sheffield, York, and all the manufacturing towns in
Yorkshire:&mdash;here are also York, Manchester, Lynn, Bury
waggons, &amp;c.&mdash;also a Barge to Yarmouth every Monday,
Tuesday, Thursday and Friday.</p>
<p>The Diocese of Norwich consists of a Bishop, Chancellor,
Archdeacon, Commissaries, and other officers of the
Ecclesiastical Court, a Dean, Prebendaries, Minor-Canons, and
other officers of the cathedral.&nbsp; The Bishop&rsquo;s office
is in the upper close&mdash;the Consistory court is held in the
cathedral, about once in three weeks&mdash;the Dean and
Chapter&rsquo;s office is in the
cloyster&mdash;Archdeacon&rsquo;s office at Mr. Steward&rsquo;s,
Bank street.</p>

<p>A sketch of the actions and characters of those persons born
in this city, who have distinguished themselves by their talents
or application, would furnish ample materials for an interesting
volume; yet, to pass over so important a topic entirely, might be
censurable; brief particulars of some few of the most eminent are
here given:&mdash;</p>
<p>William Bateman, commonly known as William de Norwico, was
born in the beginning of the 14th century, (his father
represented the City in Parliament in 1326;) he received the
rudiments of education at Norwich, and afterwards at Cambridge
studied the civil law, and was early noticed for his literary
acquirements, Bishop Ayremine recommended him to Rome, <!-- page
51--><a name="page51"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 51</span>where
he soon acquired several offices of trust and honor; he was sent
as Nuncio, to mediate for peace between Edward III. and the King
of France, and was honorably received on his return to England in
1345: he is said to have been tenacious of the perquisites and
privileges of office; he founded and endowed Trinity Hall,
Cambridge, in 1347; in 1354, being sent by Edward III. to
acquaint the Pope with the nature of the King&rsquo;s claim to
the Crown of France, he died at Avignon, then the residence of
the Pope, and was buried in the Cathedral there in 1354.</p>
<p>Matthew Parker, was born in St. Saviour&rsquo;s parish, August
6th, 1504, he received his education in Corpus Christi College,
Cambridge, where he made rapid progress in almost every kind of
learning; he was appointed Chaplain to Queen Ann Boleyn, and
through her interest obtained several preferments;&mdash;and on
her being brought to the scaffold, the Princess Elizabeth, with a
solemn injunction, was put under his care.&nbsp; He was shortly
after made Vice Chancellor of the Cambridge University; he was
appointed Chaplain to King Edward the VIth. and in 1552 preferred
to the Deanery of Lincoln; he withdrew from his native country in
Queen Mary&rsquo;s reign, but was recalled on her death, and
appointed to the See of Canterbury by her successor.&nbsp; In his
character he combined learning and religion, in his household he
was hospitable and courteous, of his charity his liberal
benefactions bear ample testimony; he collected many valuable
manuscripts, <!-- page 52--><a name="page52"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 52</span>which he gave to the library of the
College where he received his education: he was a profound
Antiquarian, and was the author of <i>Antiquitates
Britannic&aelig;</i>; he caused many valuable records where
copies were scarce to be printed; he published some other works,
and superintended a translation of the Scriptures from the
original tongue, known by the name of the Bishops Bible; he died
at his palace in Lambeth, May 17, 1575.</p>
<p>John Kaye or Cains, was born in Norwich, in 1510, and received
his education at Cambridge.&nbsp; He finished his studies on the
Continent, where he wrote many books, and formed numerous
valuable literary acquaintance; on his return to England he
practised as a Physician in Norwich with great success, and in
1557 he was considered the most able practitioner of medicine in
the kingdom: he was physician to King Edward VI. and held the
same office to Queen Mary, with whom he was in high favor; in the
latter part of his life he retired to Cambridge, but being called
to London on some urgent business, he was taken ill, and died in
July, 1573, and was buried in Caius College Chapel, Cambridge; he
exercised his pen on almost every branch of learning, and left
upwards of four-score different treatises on various
subjects.</p>
<p>William Cuningham, was born in Norwich, in 1531; he studied
physic, and graduated at Heidelburgh; he wrote several treatises
on Astronomy, Chronology and Medicine, particularly the
Cosmographical Glass&mdash;printed in 1559, at the close of which
year he died.</p>

53</span>Thomas Legge, born in 1535, was student at Cambridge,
and succeeded his friend Caius in the mastership of Caius
College; he was a great and distinguished Antiquarian; having
attached himself to the Law, he was appointed King&rsquo;s legal
professor, and twice filled the vice Chancellor&rsquo;s chair; he
was also a dramatic writer, he died in 1607.</p>
<p>John Cosin, was born in Norwich, in 1594, he studied in Caius
College, Cambridge; he was promoted to several church
preferments, which, at the commencement of the civil wars, he was
deprived of, being the first clergyman who suffered that species
of punishment for his loyalty.&nbsp; On the return of King
Charles the II. he was appointed to the deanery of Peterborough,
and soon afterwards called to the Bishoprick of Durham, and died
in 1672; he wrote some pieces on polemical divinity.</p>
<p>Edward Brown, was born in this city about the year 1642, he
was educated at the grammar school, and in 1665 took the degree
of Bachelor in Physic, at Cambridge, and was soon after admitted
at Oxford, where he in 1667 obtained a doctor&rsquo;s diploma; he
then travelled over great part of the Continent, and on his
return, published an account of his travels, which contain some
valuable information of Natural History, particularly on
Minerology and Metallurgy; after settling in London, he was
appointed physician to King Charles the II. and in 1705, became
president of the College of physicians, which office he held till
his death; he was well versed in the living and the dead
languages; he died in 1708, at his seat at Northfleet, in
Kent.</p>
<p><!-- page 54--><a name="page54"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
54</span>Doctor Samuel Clarke, the son of Edward Clarke, esq. an
alderman of Norwich, and for several years one of its
representatives in Parliament; he was born in 1675, and completed
his studies at Cambridge, where he soon distinguished himself,
particularly in the Mathematics; the Newtonian Philosophy
attracted his notice, and by his illustration of that theory, he
obtained very considerable credit at the early age of 22; he
afterwards applied himself to divinity, and was appointed to some
church preferments, but from his attachment to Mathematical
knowledge, he was unwilling to admit any thing for truth which
did not allow of that kind of demonstration; this gave a bias to
his judgment, which is apparent in all his writings.&nbsp; In
1706, he published a Latin edition of Sir Isaac Newton&rsquo;s
Optics, on the credit of which, he was noticed by Queen Ann, and
appointed to the valuable rectory of St. James&rsquo;s,
Westminster; in 1710, he published C&aelig;sar&rsquo;s
Commentaries in royal folio, (one of the most magnificent Books
ever printed in England,) elucidated with eighty-seven
engravings.&nbsp; On the death of Sir Isaac Newton, he was
offered the lucrative place of Master of the Mint, which he
refused, as being incompatible with his character as a clergyman;
he died in 1729: his writings were very voluminous, and will
remain a lasting monument of his uncommon abilities and profound
learning.</p>
<p>Edward King, F. R. and A. S. S. was born at Norwich, in 1734;
in 1748, he was sent to Cambridge to finish his education; he
soon distinguished himself by his progress and regularity.&nbsp;
<!-- page 55--><a name="page55"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
55</span>Having obtained academical honors, he entered a student
at Lincoln&rsquo;s-Inn, and from thence practised at the Bar for
some time, with great credit; but coming to a large fortune by
the death of his father, he quitted the profession, and applied
himself to scientific pursuits; he was particularly calculated
for profound research; he had long been an active and useful
member of both the Royal and Antiquarian Societies, and became
vice president of the latter in 1781, and president in 1783; he
resigned the latter the year following; his works were numerous
and his observations on Ancient Castles, is in great
repute.&nbsp; He died in London, April, 1807.&nbsp; There are
some other eminent men, who (although not natives,) have spent
the principal part of their time in Norwich, of whom a slight
notice may not be unacceptable.</p>
<p>Herbert de Losinga, the first Bishop Norwich was born in
Normandy, from whence he was brought by William the II. towards
the close of the 11th Century: Henry I. appointed him his
chancellor.&nbsp; He is said to have been very loose and wild in
his young time, although afterwards he became quite the reverse,
he was an excellent scholar for the time in which he lived, to
atone for the extravagancies of his early years, he founded the
Cathedral, the Bishops Palace, &amp;c.</p>
<p>Joseph Hall, was born in Leicestershire, in 1574; at the age
of fifteen was sent to Cambridge, to finish his education, and at
the age of twenty-three distinguished himself as a wit and a
poet, he became successively Bishop of Exeter and Norwich, but
was soon bereaved of <!-- page 56--><a name="page56"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 56</span>all his preferments and properly by
religious persecution; in 1647, he retired to a little estate he
rented at Heigham, where he died in September, 1656, and was
buried in the chancel of the parish church there; he was by
foreigners stiled the English Seneca; his works are numerous,
which are collected and printed in three volumes, folio.</p>
<p>Norwich is 108 miles from London by Newmarket, 110 by
Colchester, 114 by Bury St. Edmunds, and it is a remarkable fact,
that Norwich, Bury and Lynn, form an equilateral triangle, each
side measuring 42 miles, it is also 43 miles from Ipswich, and 24
from Yarmouth.&nbsp; The soil of Norwich is mixed the upper
stratum is light of sufficient depth for the plough upon chalk,
gravel and sand; the air is remarkably salubrious, it is screened
from the easterly wind by Moushold Heath, and abound in springs
of water of the purest kind.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://www.gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
